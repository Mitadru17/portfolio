This folder is for your music playlist files.

For the Spotify player to work, you'll need to add:

1. Audio files (.mp3) for each song in your playlist
2. Cover images (.jpg/.png) for each song

Files needed based on the current playlist configuration:
- dil-ibaadat.mp3
- dil-ibaadat.jpg
- tum-mile.mp3
- tum-mile.jpg
- ae-dil-hai-mushkil.mp3
- ae-dil-hai-mushkil.jpg
- channa-mereya.mp3
- channa-mereya.jpg
- bulleya.mp3
- bulleya.jpg

You'll need to either:
1. Add these files to this folder
2. Or modify the playlist.ts file to point to your actual files

Note: Modern browsers require either:
- Audio files to be hosted on the same domain
- The server serving the audio files must have CORS headers configured properly
- Or you can use publicly available audio URLs (e.g., from a CDN)
