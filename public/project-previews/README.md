# Project Preview Images

Place the following images in this directory to display project previews on your portfolio:

## Image Requirements

- Images should be in JPG or JPEG format
- Recommended size: 600Ã—400 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Keep file sizes under 200KB for optimal loading performance

## Obtaining Images

You can get images by:

1. Taking screenshots of your actual projects
2. Using free stock photos that represent your project themes
3. Creating mockups using design tools like Figma or Photoshop

## Fallback Behavior

If an image is missing, the project card will display a pattern background as a fallback.
